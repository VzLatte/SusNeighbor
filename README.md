# 🕵️‍♂️ Suspicious Neighbor: Protocol Deduction Engine

![Suspicious Neighbor](./public/banner.png) 
## 🚀 The Vision
**Suspicious Neighbor** is a high-stakes, AI-powered social deduction PWA designed for mobile-first party play. It bridges the gap between classic "hidden role" games and modern Generative AI, creating infinite replayability through dynamic mission generation.

Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, it leverages the **Gemini 1.5 Flash API** to act as a "Neural Game Master," crafting unique backstories, projects, and "suspicious" constraints for every round.

## 🛠 Strategic Tech Stack
* **Core:** React 18 + TypeScript (Strict Mode)
* **Animation:** Framer Motion (for that "Native App" tactile feel)
* **AI Engine:** Google Gemini SDK (Dynamic scenario & word-pair generation)
* **PWA:** `vite-plugin-pwa` (Offline caching, standalone mobile installation)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Dark-mode optimized Slate/Indigo palette)

## 🧠 Key Features

### 1. Neural Mission Generation
Unlike static deduction games, Suspicious Neighbor uses AI to generate:
* **Cohesive Locations:** The AI ensures the "Real Project" and "Imposter Project" share enough semantic DNA to make detection difficult.
* **Virus Purge (PvE):** A collaborative mode where players hunt an AI-generated virus through noise-word analysis.

### 2. Advanced Role Ecosystem
Beyond Neighbors and Imposters, the engine supports:
* **The Oracle:** Knows the Imposter but must remain hidden.
* **The Mimic:** Can clone attributes of other roles.
* **The Anarchist:** Wins if they are successfully eliminated by the group.

### 3. Economic Layer (The Auction)
A unique **Credit & Bidding system** allows players to bid on "Power-Ups" or "Risk Contracts" at the start of the game, adding a layer of resource management to the social deduction.
